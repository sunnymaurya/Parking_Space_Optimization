PARKING SPACE OPTIMIZATION WITH C++
BY SUNNY KUMAR MAURYA

PROBLEM

With a rise in the population as well the standard of the living of the people,
the number of the vehicles has exponentially increased. 
However with the scarcity of the land the problem to accommodate the vehicles has emerged as a major issue.
Parking therefore has become a huge problem in the metropolitan cities now-a-days. The parking crisis’re very heavy at the metro system. Recently the issue gained a lot of heat and media attention as well. Though many infrastructural steps have been taken like multi-level parking system, underground parking but it is not possible 
in some areas and require huge capital and manpower as well as an input.
In India especially in a metropolitan city like Delhi hardly any non-infrastructural measure has been neither thought of nor implemented as well. Hence a need to allocation of parking based algorithm is felt.


PROJECT IDEA
Our aim is to optimize the parking space (with the emphasis on Metro Stations and Commercial Parking Lots). We aim to maximise number of cars in a given area and decrease the time taken to taken to move in and out of the parking lot.

TOOLS USED
Turbo C++, Adobe Flash , Adobe Photoshop, Google Maps

ALGORITHM FACTORS
 To optimize the dividing the users into the three major groupsRandom Users, Evening Users and Night Users.
 Area of the parking lot
 Percentage of different types of the users.
 Allocating the separate and specific areas to each group depending upon the accession time.
 The day of the week (Weekdays and Weekends) as the number/percentage is heavily influenced of the users is heavily influenced by that.



 The approach to the problem has been solved via using a coordinate system .
 Users have been distributed into three categories:-
 Daily Night Users
 Daily Evening Users
 Random Users
 We have divided our parking lot into sections depending on percentage of users.
 The division is based on distances measured from entry/exit gate taking into account various factors such as allotment of proportionate spaces, day (weekday/weekend/holiday), size of car, area of parking lot .

INPUT OF THE ALGORITHM
• Number of the Users in different groups( Night, Random and Evening)
• Area of the Parking lot
• Percentage of different types of the users.
• The day of the week (Weekdays and Weekends) as the number/percentage is heavily influenced of the users is heavily influenced by that.


OUTPUT OF THE ALGORITHM
 Maximum capacity of the parking lot.
 Parking lot Design showing the areas allocated to different users groups and the pattern in which the cars will be parked.
 Parking lot design prevailing these days showing parking pattern(Ideal Case).
 Comparison between the two designs
 Unused area in both cases
 Increase in the number of cars parked
 Percentage increase in the number of cars parked.


FEASIBILITY:
 The algorithm is highly feasible as it has been simulated on Moti Nagar Metro Station.
 Though a code assumes the plot to be rectangular (which many of the parking lots) are, we can implement the algorithm on all polygon shaped plots by dividing the plot further into the grids.
 The algorithm assumes that the cars are of the size (3 X 2) which is the average standard size of general cars (including the SUVs, sedans etc.).
CASE STUDY:
To design our algorithm we took many metro stations’ parking design like Huda City Centre, Moti Nagar, IFFCO Chowk, Sikanderpur and Guru Dronancharya Metro Stations which face heavy parking crisis.


DATA OF SOME OF THE METRO STATIONS ANALYZED
IFFCO Chowk: Parking Lot of 5950 sq. metre for the 170 cars
MG ROAD: Parking Lot of 876 sq. metres for the 25 cars
SIKANDERPUR: Parking Lot of 1577 sq. metre for the 45 cars
GURU DRONACHARYA : Parking Lot of 4572 sq. metre for the 130 cars
